# Sports-Analytics-Project

This project was implemented as a part of project for the subject Sports Analytics in Practice for my Masters Degree in Data Science from La Trobe University.

**Task:**

1. Construct at least two different AFL win probability models, and at least two different AFL
margin prediction models

• Models should be trained on historical AFL data. Data may be collected from any
source (e.g. from the fitzRoy R package, or AFL tables website).

• Model parameters should be tuned to optimize performance on the given tasks.

• You must provide evidence of the predictive performance of your models on
historical data.

2. Apply your prediction models, week-by-week, to each game of the 2023 AFL finals series
• i.e. generate win probability and margin estimates for each finals game for each
model
3. Use your match win probability models to simulate the finishing positions of each finals
team, before the start of the finals

• i.e. for each team in the top 8 forecast the probability of them finishing in each of
the possible positions; eliminated week 1, eliminated week 2, eliminated week 3,
lose grand final, or premiership

4. Finally, Evaluate how well each of your models and simulations did by comparing your predictions to
the actual results of the 2023 AFL finals series.
